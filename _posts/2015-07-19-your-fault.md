title: A Home for my Long-form Rambling
---

For quite some time, my friends have been [nagging
me](<https://twitter.com/tvsutton/status/565118553809235968>) [to put
together](<https://twitter.com/Vaughn_E_Miller/status/603232042772516866>) [a
blog](<https://twitter.com/foigus/status/608800195707564032>).

Blame this site on them.

I’ve been sharing code and tips in random [Github
gists](<https://gist.github.com/pudquick>) for several years via
[tweets](<https://twitter.com/mikeymikey>) and online chats.

I’ll probably keep doing that.

But now if it’s interesting enough to write about but I can’t fit it into 140
characters, it’ll probably end up here.

And if it doesn’t - now I have no excuse to avoid blogging about it when you nag
me.

Happy now?
