        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;[ &lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This blog post is only a personal, ficticious thought experiment. If you&amp;#39;re a Mac administrator, I recommend you read it. Regardless of whether this thought experiment turns out to be reality or fiction, the conclusion contains some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good advice that I&amp;#39;d recommend - no matter what the future holds. &lt;em&gt;- mike&lt;/em&gt; ]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howdy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been almost a year or so since my last blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been kinda busy with my fun new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to do more fun posts soon-ish (did you see this neat thing I did at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://macadmins.psu.edu&quot;&gt;PSU Macadmins&lt;/a&gt; hackathon called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pudquick/nibbler&quot;&gt;nibbler&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to take some time to write this out, since it&amp;#39;s been rattling in my head since WWDC: &lt;strong&gt;MDM is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(probably)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;coming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe. I&amp;#39;m guessing. But I think all the clues are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to the last WWDC Apple held, there was some &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; information about the things to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part is that it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;ok to talk about it&lt;/strong&gt;, because they updated their Developer License agreement section &amp;quot;Information Deemed Apple Confidential&amp;quot; to include the following words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Apple agrees that You will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to technical information about pre-release Apple Software and services disclosed by Apple at WWDC (Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that You may not post screen shots of, write public reviews of, or redistribute any pre-release Apple Software, Apple Services or hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I will be discussing here is a theoretical connect-the-dots with only two main components: Technical details &lt;u&gt;that Apple has disclosed at WWDC&lt;/u&gt; and existing features in currently shipping Apple operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did Apple talk about at WWDC that was so amazing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-apple-file-system-apfs&quot;&gt;The Apple File System (APFS)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apple had &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/701/&quot;&gt;an entire session on it&lt;/a&gt; (which you can watch without a Developer ID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At WWDC, they also made available &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html&quot;&gt;technical documentation on APFS&lt;/a&gt; (again, available without a Developer ID, even shows up in Google results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest bombshell in both of those products are these lines from the technical documents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple File System is a new, modern file system for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple plans to release Apple File System as a bootable file system in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and these words from the video session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[34:36]&lt;/strong&gt; So to summarize, Apple File System will be &lt;strong&gt;the default file system for all Apple products [in] 2017&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s ultra-modern, it&amp;#39;s crash protected, it supports Space Sharing, we support cloning and snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Apple talking at WWDC about the next family of operating systems to be released after Sierra. Apple is stating that the new default filesystem will be APFS across &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you may be asking: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does that apply to MDM and why did you even make this blog post in the first place?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost there, just need to set the stage a tad bit more 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take one other statement from the video session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[33:28]&lt;/strong&gt; Instead, Apple will provide an in-place upgrade path from HFS+ to Apple File System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the other devices besides Macs, they&amp;#39;re already running on a modified form of HFS+ with security features that you don&amp;#39;t see in macOS. APFS for these devices is basically a 2.0 filesystem of what they&amp;#39;re already doing, the next generation meant to replace and improve the existing situation. To me, this last quote feels like they&amp;#39;re saying: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;While we&amp;#39;re upgrading everything, we&amp;#39;re going to be bringing the Macs in line with everything else.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… So what do the OSes running on these filesystems on iOS/tvOS/watchOS look like right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t use open source tools or third-party tools to install them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OS is cryptographically signed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OS is effectively separate from user content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf&quot;&gt;touts these as security features&lt;/a&gt; - and I agree 100% they are and I love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has been on a direct path towards increased user privacy and OS security (see their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLGFriOKz6U&quot;&gt;BlackHat talk&lt;/a&gt;, watch for the &amp;quot;Physical One-Way Hash Function&amp;quot;) and I appreciate their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they don&amp;#39;t have it on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why wouldn&amp;#39;t they try to bring it over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they&amp;#39;re going to. Very very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, here&amp;#39;s Apple&amp;#39;s own words on it, from their session video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[23:44]&lt;/strong&gt; In addition, this allows us to unify our encryption story across all of our platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, with Sierra, Apple has given a considerable number of indicators that their OS and OS update delivery mechanism is changing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sierra now downloads from the App Store even without being signed in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It no longer shows up in your Apple ID&amp;#39;s purchase history, even if signed in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loopinsight.com/2016/10/03/apple-to-make-macos-sierra-available-as-automatic-download-beginning-today/&quot;&gt;automatically download to your machine&lt;/a&gt; if you have &amp;quot;download newly available updates&amp;quot; enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Software Update Service is deprecated (see the bottom of &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206871&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I hear you asking: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does this all have to do with MDM?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple looks to be rapidly shifting how OS delivery works on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if they&amp;#39;re changing OS installation to &amp;quot;unify our OS story&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if the entire OS that is macOS - if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it was protected, like it is on iOS/tvOS/watchOS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t just mean &lt;code&gt;/System&lt;/code&gt; and the things that SIP protects now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that the &amp;quot;Install macOS Sierra.app&amp;quot; installs on your machine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re talking &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt;, portions of &lt;code&gt;/Library&lt;/code&gt;, etc. in addition to everything SIP already protects in Sierra now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you an administrator of Macs like I am?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you couldn&amp;#39;t change &lt;code&gt;ntp.conf&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;code&gt;ssh_config&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or mess with the default User Template? &lt;em&gt;(I can&amp;#39;t stand it if you do this, but it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; supported by Apple right now)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is macOS was locked away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you manage it?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; How does Apple offer the ability to do that now with iOS and tvOS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; Profiles!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you get those on your iOS devices in an automated fashion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; MDM! (or Configurator, in some cases)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If APFS is the gateway that makes macOS immutable, the road to it is being paved in whatever OS comes after Sierra, where it will be landing as the default filesystem (if they keep to their goals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; fast movement on Apple&amp;#39;s part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public testing of a &lt;em&gt;brand new&lt;/em&gt; filesystem APFS in Sierra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APFS now default filesystem in Sierra+1, with conversion of existing HFS+ filesystems to APFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... road paved for locked down OS delivery by Sierra+2 ? (Maybe +3 at the latest?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the goal of a unified filesystem making the goal of a unified OS protection scheme within tantalizing reach - I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised to see Apple take from their existing playbook and attempt to unify their OS management model as well, offering profiles as &amp;quot;the solution&amp;quot; for everything OS management related on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-39-s-the-impact-of-a-change-like-this&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s the impact of a change like this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the average computer user with .apps installed, web browsing, etc. they honestly might not notice a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… But for a Mac administrator in a large organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What good is a root-running LaunchDaemon or client agent when everything that came with the OS is immutable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does root even mean anymore in that situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you running chef? puppet? munki? Casper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your management tools performing security-oriented or legally-required customizations to your systems with custom scripts/logic you designed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if they couldn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all that&amp;#39;s left is userspace, will local administrators even need to exist? Do you have admin rights on your iOS devices right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is part of why I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeymikey/status/781621965920489472&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, asking my fellow Mac administrator followers what they&amp;#39;re doing right now that they can&amp;#39;t do with a profile at the moment on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If everything you&amp;#39;re managing right now&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#39;t filed in a radar to Apple asking for an officially approved mechanism to manage this aspect of their OS, how will Apple know to give you a handle on wrangling these settings when they change the security model of macOS to &amp;quot;unify their OS story&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lot of responses. I&amp;#39;ll be writing them up and filing them as radars. I hope you do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-39-s-more-though&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s more, though&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a Mac administrator, the impact of such a change as this would be much more than just settings management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you &amp;quot;golden master&amp;quot; / block level restore your iOS devices with tools like AutoDMG, Imagr, DeployStudio, or Casper Imaging?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or do you use Apple Configurator because that&amp;#39;s the only choice that&amp;#39;s available?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Apple is going to &amp;quot;unify [their] encryption story&amp;quot; on macOS, do you think any of the tools you have now will be able to install this new style of OS deployment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you NetBoot image iPhones and iPads?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… &lt;em&gt;I know, I know,&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m reallllly stretching the comparisons &lt;em&gt;quite a bit&lt;/em&gt; here - the technological history of these families of devices were vastly different and resulted in different technology management chains and solutions …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… But Apple is in a unifying phase now, and the dates they promise seem like they&amp;#39;re &lt;strong&gt;accelerating it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re willing to kill off a very mature filesystem like HFS+, why wouldn&amp;#39;t they be willing to kill off NetBoot (FYI: introduced a year &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; HFS+)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story I paint here is quite possibly the death of most management and imaging workflows in enterprise existence today for macOS (or, at best, the ignition for the firey phoenix-like rebirth of the existing tools we have today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, this will feel like a bleak story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even a scary one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I personally think it&amp;#39;s a worthy goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there will be &lt;em&gt;a lot of blood, sweat, and toil&lt;/em&gt; for the administrators trying to get their environments compatible should this new future come to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if this is the future, Apple &lt;em&gt;really really really&lt;/em&gt; needs to engage more organizations directly and plainly about this future. We would need their help in making this a successful transition as much as Apple would need our help keeping our organizations from being so overwhelmed they&amp;#39;d consider moving to Linux or Windows to avoid the pain of such a major revamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have undocumented internal changes in the name of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workarounds for &lt;em&gt;bad bad bad&lt;/em&gt; experiences (automated GarageBand and Xcode installs with all the components, anyone? I mean &lt;strong&gt;come on&lt;/strong&gt;, this isn&amp;#39;t even third-party software !!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Script after script after script (reordering wifi networks? trying to get certs working with third-party VPN clients?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… But if Apple doesn&amp;#39;t know about them and hasn&amp;#39;t heard about them from us, they might assume that they&amp;#39;ve provided us (the administrative community) with 95%+ of the tools that we need. Instead of the closer to 15-25% (or less) reality you feel you&amp;#39;re successfully &amp;quot;mitigating&amp;quot; with internal solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-what-about-reliability&quot;&gt;And what about reliability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if Apple followed the model they have in iOS right now and the advanced &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; management profiles required DEP / supervision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of those settings on iOS. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised to see more of them appear on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if DEP was critical to the management settings you needed - and …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… &lt;strong&gt;DEP&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… &lt;strong&gt;went&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… &lt;strong&gt;down?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s happened already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now spinning up new devices for your organization is &lt;strong&gt;stopped&lt;/strong&gt; because DEP has an outage - and there&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;literally nothing you can do but wait&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally no amount of money your organization can spend on engineers to reduce the time of this problem to an equivalent-to-zero value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is DEP as a purchasing and/or network service even available in all the markets where your organization currently purchases devices? Do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-how-about-apns&quot;&gt;Or how about APNS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDM uses APNS to push a trigger to clients to check in sooner for updated management instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if APNS fails? Your clients would still check in ... eventually ... sometime ... maybe in 6 hours-ish? Is that fast enough? Is that level of configuration responsiveness compatible with your enterprise environment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-about-cost&quot;&gt;How about cost?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I know of a grand total of 2 open source MDM projects that specifically target macOS. And they are brand new - the oldest is a year old. And being brand new, they are raw tools for people who know what they&amp;#39;re doing and to experiment on. You would be hard-pressed to enroll your organization of 500+ devices into them today and expect to be able to manage all the things you want (even if all the profiles you needed magically already existed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you&amp;#39;re almost mandatorily looking at a pay-for MDM vendor solution when you may not currently have one (common when your organization relies on open source tools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cost your organization hasn&amp;#39;t currently budgeted for your Macs. And it&amp;#39;s also a product that any engineers you had working on your open source tools won&amp;#39;t necessarily be able to have as much of an instant impact on, as the MDM solution will be closed source and you&amp;#39;ll be restricted in what you can do by the product&amp;#39;s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would your engineers even be able to work on open source MDM?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/MobileDeviceManagementProtocolRef/3-MDM_Protocol/MDM_Protocol.html&quot;&gt;some of the MDM specs published&lt;/a&gt; but this isn&amp;#39;t all of the documentation they have. Some of the documentation is gated behind their MDM Vendor program, which is only available to Apple Enterprise customers. Additionally, an open source MDM would need an Apple signed MDM cert to function correctly, also available through members of the MDM Vendor program. Apple hasn&amp;#39;t made it easy for open source MDM to exist, let alone functionally run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a school? Do you even have engineers? Do you even have a budget for something like this? Or at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-likely-is-this&quot;&gt;How likely is this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bushel.com/rename&quot;&gt;JAMF just renamed their MDM solution Bushel&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;quot;JAMF Now&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… Does that make Casper &amp;quot;JAMF Then&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe ask someone at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-could-one-do-to-prepare&quot;&gt;What could one do to prepare?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory your existing management settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to find configuration profile solutions for all of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they don&amp;#39;t exist, file radars with Apple listing the following things:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the setting and configuration options you need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why the setting is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain the impact of being unable to change this setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain whether alternative methods exist currently to change it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly identify the number of impacted Macs / possible sales this could impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your organization has an Apple business contact, you should talk to them about the feasibility of managing your organization&amp;#39;s Macs with MDM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do business in countries other than the US, you should check with Apple on the availability of DEP-enrolled Mac purchasing and service globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t boo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugreport.apple.com/&quot;&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apple's BookmarkData - exposed!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(And we&amp;#39;ll cover &lt;code&gt;.sfl&lt;/code&gt; files while we&amp;#39;re at it!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Sacrilicious&quot;&gt;Allister&lt;/a&gt;, had an interesting question on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://macadmins.org/&quot;&gt;MacAdmins Slack&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;@allister: zero hits on developer.apple.com for this file extension: Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentServers.sfl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wit: What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;.sfl&lt;/code&gt; files that are appearing in OS X 10.11 El Capitan? There sure are a lot of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diving into the file format, it was pretty obvious it was a binary plist - and with a little more digging, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSKeyedArchiver_Class/index.html&quot;&gt;NSKeyedArchiver&lt;/a&gt; file at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being &lt;a href=&quot;http://michaellynn.github.io/2015/07/26/exploring-os-x-preview-signatures/&quot;&gt;very familiar&lt;/a&gt; with NSKeyedArchiver formats now, it didn&amp;#39;t take a whole lot of effort to come up with a script that allowed me to extract the contents of the com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentServers.sfl file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is - it didn&amp;#39;t take a lot of effort to extract the &lt;strong&gt;initial&lt;/strong&gt; layer of contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{
    items =     (
        &amp;quot;&amp;lt;SFLListItem: 0x7faf19dac350&amp;gt;&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;&amp;lt;SFLListItem: 0x7faf19cc5430&amp;gt;&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;&amp;lt;SFLListItem: 0x7faf19cca510&amp;gt;&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;&amp;lt;SFLListItem: 0x7faf19dac5a0&amp;gt;&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;&amp;lt;SFLListItem: 0x7faf19da92e0&amp;gt;&amp;quot;
    );
    properties =     {
        &amp;quot;com.apple.LSSharedFileList.MaxAmount&amp;quot; = 10;
    };
    version = 1;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=01_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart, it&amp;#39;s a dictionary with 3 keys, the most interesting key being &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; array is made up of &lt;code&gt;SFLListItem&lt;/code&gt;, a new internal object in 10.11, with the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;: Display name in the list (in this case, the name of the volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt;: Number representing order within the list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;uniqueIdentifier&lt;/code&gt;: A NSUUID generated to uniquely represent the entry in the list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;properties&lt;/code&gt;: A dictionary with one or more keys (all of these only had &amp;quot;com.apple.LSSharedFileList.OverrideIcon.OSType&amp;quot; with the value &amp;quot;srvr&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bookmark&lt;/code&gt;: An NSURL BookmarkData object containing information to reach the file/shares&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look up &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURL_Class/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000301-SW34&quot;&gt;Apple&amp;#39;s documentation about BookmarkData&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll find details about how to make them, how to open them, and how to get some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; basic details from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you want to just get the share URL that was used to create the BookmarkData in the first place, the only API call Apple offers is &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURL_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSURL/URLByResolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeToURL:bookmarkDataIsStale:error:&quot;&gt;this rather unsavory one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;NSURL
+(instancetype)URLByResolvingBookmarkData:(NSData *)bookmarkData&lt;br&gt;
                                  options:(NSURLBookmarkResolutionOptions)options&lt;br&gt;
                            relativeToURL:(NSURL *)relativeURL&lt;br&gt;
                      bookmarkDataIsStale:(BOOL *)isStale&lt;br&gt;
                                    error:(NSError * &lt;em&gt;Nullable *)error&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=02&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;snip.m&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;quot;unsavory&amp;quot; because of the implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;This method fails&lt;/span&gt; if the original file or directory could not be located or is on a volume that could not be mounted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this method fails, you can use the resourceValuesForKeys:fromBookmarkData: method to obtain information about the bookmark, such as the last known path (NSURLPathKey) to help the user decide how to proceed.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the options &lt;code&gt;NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithoutMounting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithoutUI&lt;/code&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll find &lt;a href=&quot;http://tangent405.com/dealing-with-slow-security-scoped-bookmarks&quot;&gt;articles like this one&lt;/a&gt; which indicate that the OS is going to attempt to resolve the resource, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t pop up anything to the user when it can&amp;#39;t find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yet&lt;/em&gt;, if you open up the BookmarkData in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/&quot;&gt;hex editor&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;obvious&lt;/strong&gt; the URL information is there in a form it should be directly extractable from. For something like a normal network share, there is absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no reason&lt;/strong&gt; to need to do any sort of resolving to be able to return this data. We should be able to just say &amp;quot;Give me the URL&amp;quot; and it should instantly return the value (instead of failing because the server isn&amp;#39;t visible on the current network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about the aforementioned &lt;code&gt;resourceValuesForKeys:fromBookmarkData:&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;USELESS!&lt;/span&gt; The NSURLPathKey for server shares appears to return the mounted volume path (&lt;code&gt;/Volumes/whatever&lt;/code&gt;) - &lt;strong&gt;not the URL of the server share itself&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… Maybe it&amp;#39;s a resource value in a different key?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suddenly - &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; horrible implementation details: &lt;em&gt;You can&amp;#39;t get the list of available keys!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you search, everyone just recommends &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/313438-how-to-get-bookmarks-data-for-non-existing-files.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;try all the keys&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &amp;quot;try the keys you want values for&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… But &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURL_Class/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000301-DontLinkElementID_1&quot;&gt;none of the keys&lt;/a&gt; Apple has documented return just the simple share URL. They apparently want you to only use &lt;code&gt;URLByResolvingBookmarkData&lt;/code&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-hell-with-that&quot;&gt;To hell with that!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead, let&amp;#39;s go exploring with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hopperapp.com&quot;&gt;my favorite disassembler&lt;/a&gt; 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Apple&amp;#39;s documentation, NSURL is part of Foundation and sure enough we can find the &lt;code&gt;NSURL.h&lt;/code&gt; header file within &lt;code&gt;Foundation.framework&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;#39;s see what Hopper tells us &lt;code&gt;URLByResolvingBookmarkData&lt;/code&gt; is doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;void * +&lt;a href=&quot;void%20*%20self,%20void%20*%20_cmd,%20void%20*%20arg_8,%20unsigned%20int%20arg_C,%20void%20*%20arg_10,%20char%20*%20arg_14,%20void%20*%20*%20arg_18&quot;&gt;NSURL(NSURL) URLByResolvingBookmarkData:options:relativeToURL:bookmarkDataIsStale:error:&lt;/a&gt; {
    eax = [self allocWithZone:0x0];
    eax = [eax initByResolvingBookmarkData:arg_8 options:arg_C relativeToURL:arg_10 bookmarkDataIsStale:arg_14 error:arg_18];
    eax = [eax autorelease];
    return eax;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=03_snip.m&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick inspection shows this to be a wrapper around &lt;code&gt;initByResolvingBookmarkData&lt;/code&gt;, on with the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;edi = CFURLCreateByResolvingBookmarkData(*&lt;em&gt;kCFAllocatorDefault, arg_8, arg_C, edi, 0x0, arg_14, arg_18);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=04&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;snip.c&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That CF looks like we&amp;#39;re skipping on over to &lt;code&gt;CoreFoundation.framework&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;int &lt;em&gt;CFURLCreateByResolvingBookmarkData(int arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4, int arg5) {&lt;br&gt;
    r9 = arg5;&lt;br&gt;
    r15 = arg4;&lt;br&gt;
    r12 = arg3;&lt;br&gt;
    r13 = arg2;&lt;br&gt;
    rbx = arg1;&lt;br&gt;
    r14 = arg0;&lt;br&gt;
    rax = *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CFCoreServicesInternal&lt;/strong&gt;CFURLCreateByResolvingBookmarkData.dyfunc;&lt;br&gt;
    if (rax == 0xff) {&lt;br&gt;
            rax = &lt;strong&gt;_CFLookupCoreServicesInternalFunction(&amp;quot;_CFURLCreateByResolvingBookmarkData&amp;quot;);&lt;br&gt;
            *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CFCoreServicesInternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;CFURLCreateByResolvingBookmarkData.dyfunc = rax;&lt;br&gt;
    }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=05&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;snip.c&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruh roh!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function isn&amp;#39;t defined here, it&amp;#39;s apparently a &amp;quot;CFCoreServicesInternal&amp;quot; bit of code. Now where could that be defined? …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… Let&amp;#39;s check our good friends over at &lt;code&gt;/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks&lt;/code&gt; 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh my&lt;/em&gt;, there appears to be a &lt;code&gt;CoreServicesInternal.framework&lt;/code&gt; there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/BookmarkData1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow.&lt;/strong&gt; This looks like the place to be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re here, let&amp;#39;s take a glance at all the internal things Apple does with BookmarkData …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/BookmarkData2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OH &lt;em&gt;HELLLLLLOOoo… what do we have here???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;returnAllPropertiesInBookmark&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;returnAllPropertyKeysInBookmark&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;returnDetailedDump&lt;/code&gt; you say? &lt;em&gt;Fascinating&lt;/em&gt; function names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visiting any one of those functions, I&amp;#39;m extremely curious to see how they get &lt;strong&gt;called&lt;/strong&gt;. So we use Hopper&amp;#39;s helpful &amp;quot;Show Places Calling This Procedure…&amp;quot; and all 3 take us to &lt;code&gt;BookmarkResourcePropertyKeyToInfoStructInit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/BookmarkData3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😱 😭 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do my eyes deceive me?&lt;/em&gt; Are these &lt;strong&gt;secret undocumented NSURL&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;resourceValuesForKeys:&lt;/code&gt; keys !??!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sure as hell look like it! Let&amp;#39;s try ‘em out!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about we try &lt;code&gt;NSURLBookmarkAllPropertiesKey&lt;/code&gt;, first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;(*insert magical handwaving, skipping over the boring part to get to the amazing part*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NSURL.resourceValuesForKeys_fromBookmarkData_([&amp;#39;NSURLBookmarkAllPropertiesKey&amp;#39;], some_bookmark_data)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good god. It worked. It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the keys Apple lists - and &lt;strong&gt;a ton that they don&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… and yet … none of them are what I&amp;#39;m looking for: just the plain URL to the share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSURLBookmarkAllPropertyKeysKey&lt;/code&gt; turns out to be a bit of a repeat, listing only the keys (but without values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to guess what &lt;code&gt;NSURLBookmarkDetailedDescription&lt;/code&gt; does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;knocked my socks off&lt;/span&gt;, that&amp;#39;s what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve clipped bits out here, but it&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;programmer&amp;#39;s debug output&lt;/strong&gt; for the entire BookmarkData structure, giving all of the offset values within the data and breaking down &lt;em&gt;what&amp;#39;s actually contained in it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply amazing. Everything I could have asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The URL of the share itself shows up like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;11) itemType=0x2050 flags=0x0 dataOffset=0x148 volMountURL:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;CFURL 0x7fb2b1691d30 [0x7fff767fbed0]&amp;gt;{string = smb://username@192.168.0.1/shares, encoding = 134217984, base = (null)}&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the information this undocumented debug output provides, I was able to determine the entire structure of the BookmarkData format, which I&amp;#39;ll now document here 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bookmarkdata-structure&quot;&gt;The BookmarkData Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/BookmarkExample.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we&amp;#39;ll go over this simple 260 byte version of a BookmarkData structure which contains only a single TOC with a single data record. The details I give here were collected after looking at quite a few samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unless specified otherwise, all integers are unsigned and little endian)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bookmarkdata-header&quot;&gt;BookmarkData Header&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(all examples appeared to be 48 bytes in length)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/Structure_01_Header.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 4 byte string: &lt;strong&gt;BookmarkData signature&lt;/strong&gt; (can be &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt;, the new style, or &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt;, the original alias record of Mac OS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Total length of BookmarkData&lt;/strong&gt; structure (including header)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 4 bytes: &lt;strong&gt;Version&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(might be a big endian int&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;code&gt;1040&lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:yellow&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Offset of BookmarkData data&lt;/strong&gt; payload from beginning of BookmarkData structure (always &lt;code&gt;48&lt;/code&gt; currently)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:cyan&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; N-bytes: null / &lt;code&gt;0x00&lt;/code&gt; bytes used as &lt;strong&gt;filler&lt;/strong&gt; until the beginning of BookmarkData data payload&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bookmarkdata-data&quot;&gt;BookmarkData Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data portion is a combination of several things: TOC (table of contents) records, data records (of various kinds), and most importantly the pointer to the first TOC. The &amp;quot;Offset of BookmarkData data&amp;quot; value points to the beginning of this data structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/Structure_02_Data.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Offset of first TOC&lt;/strong&gt;, measured from the start of the BookmarkData data payload (example: an offset of &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; is actually &lt;code&gt;148&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the beginning. &lt;code&gt;48&lt;/code&gt; byte header + &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; bytes from start of data payload)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgray&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; N-bytes: The remainder of the data section is composed of TOC records (which tell where to find the data records) and the data records themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bookmarkdata-toc&quot;&gt;BookmarkData TOC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BookmarkData has the concept of a &amp;quot;first TOC&amp;quot;, the one pointed to by the beginning of the BookmarkData data payload. Each TOC has information about a number of data records as well as information on the offset of the &amp;quot;next TOC&amp;quot;. If there is no next TOC, the offset for &amp;quot;next TOC&amp;quot; will be 0. Each TOC is comprised of a header and a data section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/Structure_03_TOC.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-header&quot;&gt;TOC Header&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Length of TOC data&lt;/strong&gt; segment after the header&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 16-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Record type (TOC)&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;0xFEFF&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;65279&lt;/code&gt;. Might be signed? In which case the value would be &lt;code&gt;-2&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 16-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Flags&lt;/strong&gt; (unused for TOC, always set to &lt;code&gt;0xFFFF&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-data&quot;&gt;TOC Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:yellow&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt; (for a server mount, the value seems to be &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:cyan&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Offset of next TOC&lt;/strong&gt; record, measured from beginning of BookmarkData data section&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Number of records&lt;/strong&gt; in this TOC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[BEGIN: N number of TOC data records]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toc-data-record&quot;&gt;TOC Data Record&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 16-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Record type&lt;/strong&gt; - varies (examples: &lt;code&gt;8272&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;quot;volMountURL&amp;quot;, &lt;code&gt;8208&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;quot;volName&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:salmon&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 16-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Flags&lt;/strong&gt; (always seems to be &lt;code&gt;0x0000&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:lightblue&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 64-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Offset of record data&lt;/strong&gt;, measured from beginning of BookmarkData data portion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: That may actually be a 32-bit integer, followed by 4 null bytes - I would be surprised to see 64-bit offsets here when TOC offsets are 32-bit)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[END TOC data records]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;standard-data-record&quot;&gt;Standard Data Record&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the records pointed to by TOCs. They represent the bulk of the contents of BookmarkData and are where the real data is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/Structure_04_Records.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Length of data&lt;/strong&gt; payload, the actual data stored here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; 32-bit integer: &lt;strong&gt;Data type&lt;/strong&gt; - varies (examples: &lt;code&gt;2305&lt;/code&gt;: CFURL, &lt;code&gt;257&lt;/code&gt;: string)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt; N-bytes: &lt;strong&gt;Record data&lt;/strong&gt;, padded with &lt;code&gt;0x00&lt;/code&gt; on the end if necessary to reach a multiple of 4 bytes in length&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(… wow, you made it this far? Yay! 🎉)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you readers with a keen eye may have recognized the data coloring abilities of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.synalysis.net&quot;&gt;Synalyze It!&lt;/a&gt; and maybe you&amp;#39;re secretly hoping I&amp;#39;ve written up a formal grammar for BookmarkData using it … sadly I have not 😞. I&amp;#39;m brand new to the software and unfortunately the interface is not very intuitive when it comes to interactively creating a new grammar. I haven&amp;#39;t decided yet whether I&amp;#39;m to blame or poor UI is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… The &lt;em&gt;even sharper&lt;/em&gt; readers which have persisted this far may have noticed that the standard data record in my example doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be something you can easily extract a share URL from. There&amp;#39;s a reason for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked the older &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt; BookmarkData structure as an example because of its size (260 bytes for this one). Your average &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; modern style BookmarkData structure is well over a megabyte in size (!) because one of the records it contains is &lt;code&gt;icns&lt;/code&gt; icon information for how your share&amp;#39;s icon should look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt;-style is literally the thinnest of wrappers around what&amp;#39;s actually an original Mac OS (pre OS X) &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt; resource fork fileshare record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-10-24-apples-bookmarkdata-exposed/ResEdit.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newer &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; variant contains the record types (like &lt;code&gt;8272&lt;/code&gt; aka &amp;quot;volMountURL&amp;quot;) I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-where-we-started&quot;&gt;Back to Where We Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have records that are &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; type, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/4776b4b2075bf9b7e512&quot;&gt;I have posted quick and dirty code here&lt;/a&gt; that will give you the &amp;quot;volMountURL&amp;quot; information instantly for the &lt;code&gt;.sfl&lt;/code&gt; files that started this wild ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on more formal code for BookmarkData parsing as I write this. But now that the information is out there, maybe someone will beat me to the punch 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt;-style information, you can can attempt to use code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;url,isStale,err = NSURL.URLByResolvingBookmarkData_options_relativeToURL_bookmarkDataIsStale_error_(bookmark_data, NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithoutMounting+NSURLBookmarkResolutionWithoutUI, None, None, None)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… But don&amp;#39;t be surprised if you get back results like this if the resource no longer exists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; url is None
True
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; isStale
False
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print err.&lt;strong&gt;repr&lt;/strong&gt;()
Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-43 &amp;quot;The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error -43.)&amp;quot; (fnfErr: File not found)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/c089771fd8196f449662.js?file=08_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But worry not, friend readers - I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; completely decoded &lt;code&gt;alis&lt;/code&gt; records in python, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/al45tair/mac_alias&quot;&gt;as have others&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the AFPX mount records they can contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even resource forks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll get to it in another blog post 😆&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Even More Oracle Java Compatibility (Minecraft!)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rtrouton&quot;&gt;Rich Trouton&lt;/a&gt; kindly wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/modifying-oracles-java-sdk-to-run-java-applications-on-os-x/&quot;&gt;a wonderful blog post&lt;/a&gt; covering &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/349f063c242239952a2e/64c295fc4576d7df9b8632e6ddecbe6165fd7663&quot;&gt;a python script of mine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;note: this is the old version, don&amp;#39;t use it!&lt;/em&gt;) which modifies installations of Oracle&amp;#39;s Java JDK to extend its capabilities to allow it to run JavaApplicationStub .app bundles as was &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/6741&quot;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; on Apple&amp;#39;s Developer forums (go ahead and read it, Apple has made the forum open to the public for now). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that annoyed me a bit about the fix though was that it didn&amp;#39;t seem to work with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; (read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://minecraft.net/&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;), just a large number of Java .apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it was posted, a Twitter friend of mine &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/morningwoodspor/status/630886277538258945&quot;&gt;asked for a little more help&lt;/a&gt; with one of these more problematic apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to confirm that the app in question could run if I provided the right arguments to &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/java&lt;/code&gt;, so why couldn&amp;#39;t JavaApplicationStub launching work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little more research (aka Google) turned up &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/136976&quot;&gt;this marvelous additional tidbit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically the problematic Java .apps in question had their .jar files coded to look for &lt;code&gt;libserver.dylib&lt;/code&gt;, which isn&amp;#39;t part of the current JDK distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fix involves creating the original directory structure it expects it at and symlinking &lt;code&gt;libjvm.dylib&lt;/code&gt; to the old location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked, it fixed the launching! (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and Minecraft works as-is for me now, no more modifying the .app bundle!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/349f063c242239952a2e&quot;&gt;updated the original code&lt;/a&gt;, so that both Rich&amp;#39;s blog post and this one here provide an all-in-one solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, hope this helps you 😄&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learn you a better pyobjc Bridgesupport signature</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is about correcting function signatures in pyobjc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post has a backstory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I received a challenge that was posed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shea_craig&quot;&gt;Shea Craig&lt;/a&gt; to me on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://macadmins.org&quot;&gt;Macadmins Slack&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;#autopkg&lt;/strong&gt; channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@sheagcraig: Also, it&amp;#39;s possible that we could try to do a mount via PyObjC stuff (paging @frogor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;*(frogor is one of my &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;many names&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the discussion, a few people were wondering if it was possible to mount network shares with python in OS X (&lt;em&gt;of course it is&lt;/em&gt;) because using the command-line &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; was running into some odd situations with Kerberos ticket handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could call out to AppleScript (&lt;code&gt;osascript&lt;/code&gt;) to do it with &amp;quot;mount volume&amp;quot;, but the rest of the code involved was already written in python and there was interest in reducing the number of external tools used rather than replacing one with another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounded like a fun challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I did was pop open the relevant AppleScript code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hopperapp.com&quot;&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;. In this instance, that particular code is located in the bundle: /System/Library/ScriptingAdditions/StandardAdditions.osax&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I find that, you might ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re using AppleScript to speak to a particular application that has its own custom commands (aka dictionary), the built-in commands for AppleScript that aren&amp;#39;t just part of the AppleScript language itself are mostly stored in the &amp;quot;Standard Additions&amp;quot; scripting addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open up Script Editor and select &lt;em&gt;File -&amp;gt; Open Dictionary...&lt;/em&gt; and select StandardAdditions.osax, you can see the &amp;quot;mount volume&amp;quot; command and its associated documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-08-08-learn-you-a-better-pyobjc-bridgesupport-signature/StandardAdditions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening the executable in Hopper, unfortunately you can&amp;#39;t just search for &amp;quot;mount volume&amp;quot; and find the relevant code. This is because AppleScript additions have a translation layer called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_creating_sdef/SAppsCreateSdef.html&quot;&gt;Scripting Definition File&lt;/a&gt; that maps the AppleScript language syntax to the code behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the &amp;quot;StandardAdditions.osax&amp;quot; bundle, within /Contents/Resources you&amp;#39;ll find the &amp;quot;StandardAdditions.sdef&amp;quot; scripting definition file and the relevant definition line within it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;mount volume&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;code=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;aevtmvol&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Mount the specified server volume&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching in Hopper for &amp;quot;aevtmvol&amp;quot; reveals the function &amp;quot;_AEVTaevtmvol&amp;quot;, which has this bit of pseudocode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-asm&quot; data-lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;eax = NetFSMountURLSync(var_38, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, var_3C, esi, var_10);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks promising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Google search turns up documentation for this function via a note from Apple within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Carbon/Reference/File_Manager/#//apple_ref/c/func/FSMountServerVolumeSync&quot;&gt;File Manager legacy reference for FSMountServerVolumeSync&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;careful loading this page, &lt;strong&gt;tons&lt;/strong&gt; of Javascript&lt;/em&gt;), where it says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;To mount local volumes and to eject and unmount all volumes, use Disk Arbitration API instead (for more information, see Disk Arbitration Framework Reference). To mount a network volume, use NetFSMountURLAsync instead (to cancel a pending mount request, use NetFSMountURLCancel). &lt;strong&gt;For more information, see NetFS.h in /System/Library/Frameworks/NetFS.framework/Headers&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;*(yes, it says NetFSMountURLAsync not NetFSMountURLsync, but just bear with me)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, cool. Time to go look at some headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the file mentioned above, we find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;int
NetFSMountURLSync(
    CFURLRef url,                           // URL to mount, e.g. nfs://server/path
    CFURLRef mountpath,                     // Path for the mountpoint
    CFStringRef user,                       // Auth user name (overrides URL)
    CFStringRef passwd,                     // Auth password (overrides URL)
    CFMutableDictionaryRef open_options,    // Options for session open (see below)
    CFMutableDictionaryRef mount_options,   // Options for mounting (see below)
    CFArrayRef *mountpoints)                // Array of mountpoints&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8f09a0b8893c01637b74.js?file=01_snip.c&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a bingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the pseudocode, &lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt; (null pointer) is used in place of the user and password arguments which lines right up with the documentation &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;(overrides URL)&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; indicating that as long as someone provides the password within the URL (example: &lt;code&gt;afp://username:password@server/share&lt;/code&gt;), then they&amp;#39;re unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only arguments AppleScript passes are &lt;em&gt;url&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;open_options&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;mount_options&lt;/em&gt;, and a placeholder for getting the returned mountpoint after it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s look at &lt;em&gt;open_options&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mount_options&lt;/em&gt; to see what AppleScript put in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-asm&quot; data-lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;00014a1b         lea        eax, dword [ds:eax-0x14621+cfstring_AllowSubMounts] ; @&quot;AllowSubMounts&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the same NetFS.h file above, we can find out what this means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot; data-lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;* kNetFSAllowSubMountsKey = true        Allow a mount from a dir beneath the share point.
#define kNetFSAllowSubMountsKey         CFSTR(&quot;AllowSubMounts&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing mounting subdirectories sounds like an important setting. Are there any other good ones in there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot; data-lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;* kNAUIOptionKey = UIOption             Suppress authentication dialog UI.
#define kNAUIOptionKey                  CFSTR(&quot;UIOption&quot;)
// UIOption values                      CFStringRef
#define kNAUIOptionNoUI                 CFSTR(&quot;NoUI&quot;)
#define kNAUIOptionAllowUI              CFSTR(&quot;AllowUI&quot;)
#define kNAUIOptionForceUI              CFSTR(&quot;ForceUI&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-C&quot; data-lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;* kNetFSMountAtMountDirKey = true       Mount on the specified mountpath instead of below it.
#define kNetFSMountAtMountDirKey        CFSTR(&quot;MountAtMountDir&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could come in handy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also interesting to note that the AppleScript code provides &lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt; for mountpath, which seems to imply that not defining it will make it mount in the standard dynamic fashion at /Volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at what point do we start turning this into python code?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... How about now? 😆&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve not dealt with a lot of pyobjc, I feel a little concern as to why you&amp;#39;re reading my blog since &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/python&quot;&gt;that&amp;#39;s mostly what I write about&lt;/a&gt;. But if you do find yourself in this boat, I can point you to two wonderful writeups about it written by the venerable &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/gregneagle/&quot;&gt;Greg Neagle&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2015/02/02/command-line-tools-via-python-and-cocoa/&quot;&gt;Command-line Tools via Python and Cocoa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://managingosx.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/accessing-more-frameworks-with-python-2/&quot;&gt;Accessing More Frameworks with Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second article I linked there is an important one in relation to this blog post as it&amp;#39;s about extending pyobjc on OS X to support working with Frameworks that you can&amp;#39;t directly import within python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see how NetFS handles in this regard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;NetFS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ImportError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;No&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;named&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NetFS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s take a suggestion from that second article as to how to fix this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import objc
from CoreFoundation import CFURLCreateWithString&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bundle&lt;/strong&gt; = objc.initFrameworkWrapper(&amp;quot;NetFS&amp;quot;,
    frameworkIdentifier=&amp;quot;com.apple.NetFS&amp;quot;,
    frameworkPath=objc.pathForFramework(&amp;quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/NetFS.framework&amp;quot;),
    globals=globals())&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;share_url = CFURLCreateWithString(None, &amp;#39;afp://servername.local/sharename&amp;#39;, None)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NetFSMountURLSync
&amp;lt;objc.function &amp;#39;NetFSMountURLSync&amp;#39; at 0x10f458270&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8f09a0b8893c01637b74.js?file=02_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No errors, very promising! Let&amp;#39;s take it for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#39;t define any custom options, we&amp;#39;ll just provide a URL to mount and a list (to match the CFArrayRef for our return mountpath).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NetFSMountURLSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;share_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Traceback&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ValueError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;depythonifying&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'pointer'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;got&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'list'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruh roh. It apparently didn&amp;#39;t like my list argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapping it to None doesn&amp;#39;t help either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s expecting a pointer apparently. How do I get a pointer to a list (or an NSArray) in pyobjc? I know how to do it in ctypes - &lt;em&gt;but in pyojc???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[INTERMISSION]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point I came up with a crazy workaround, which worked, but I&amp;#39;m not putting it into this article, I&amp;#39;ll save that for another one. The technique I developed is amazingly useful for other things but is too long to write in the margins here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[END OF INTERMISSION]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem boils down to how &lt;code&gt;NetFSMountURLSync&lt;/code&gt; is defined in the bridgesupport file that shipped with OS X, located at: /System/Library/Frameworks/NetFS.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport/NetFS.bridgesupport&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;function name=&amp;#39;NetFSMountURLSync&amp;#39;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFURL=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFURL=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFString=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFString=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFDictionary=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFDictionary=}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{__CFArray}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&amp;lt;retval type=&amp;#39;i&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/function&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8f09a0b8893c01637b74.js?file=03_snip.xml&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last argument is what&amp;#39;s killing us: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;arg type=&amp;#39;^^{__CFArray}&amp;#39;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... a pointer to a pointer to a CFArray ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... aka a pointer to a CFArrayRef ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... aka a pointer to a NSArray (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFDesignConcepts/Articles/tollFreeBridgedTypes.html&quot;&gt;via bridging&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling for countless examples on how to use &lt;code&gt;NetFSMountURLSync&lt;/code&gt; show I can pass a null pointer by reference for this argument. OS X isn&amp;#39;t expecting me to pass it a CFArrayRef (NSArray), it will &lt;u&gt;build one for me&lt;/u&gt; and give me back a pointer to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really need to put anything of value &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; this function argument, I just need to get something &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without any really good ideas on how to deal with this situation, I emailed the maintainer of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/&quot;&gt;pyobjc project&lt;/a&gt; - Ronald Oussoren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; kind person and has responded to me the few times I&amp;#39;ve done this to him before. He definitely came through again this time 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His recommendation was that because all of the arguments were basically toll-free bridged types (&lt;em&gt;pointer to a CFURL&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;CFURLRef&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;NSURL&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), it would be best to rewrite the signature as taking a series of object type arguments and then changing the last argument from an input argument into an output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pyobjc has problems with double pointer signatures (&lt;code&gt;^^{__CFArray}&lt;/code&gt; - each &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; indicates a pointer &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html&quot;&gt;per the documentation&lt;/a&gt;), it has no problems with a single level of pointers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By changing the signature from &lt;code&gt;^^{__CFArray}&lt;/code&gt; (aka &lt;em&gt;pointer to a CFArrayRef&lt;/em&gt; aka &lt;em&gt;pointer to a NSArray&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;^@&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;em&gt;pointer to an object&lt;/em&gt;), pyobjc becomes able to handle it with ease! Just needed to get from &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import objc
from CoreFoundation import CFURLCreateWithString&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bundle&lt;/strong&gt; = objc.initFrameworkWrapper(&amp;quot;NetFS&amp;quot;,
    frameworkIdentifier=&amp;quot;com.apple.NetFS&amp;quot;,
    frameworkPath=objc.pathForFramework(&amp;quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/NetFS.framework&amp;quot;),
    globals=globals())&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;share_url = CFURLCreateWithString(None, &amp;#39;afp://servername.local/sharename&amp;#39;, None)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;delete-the-imported-netfsmounturlsync-so-we-can-rewrite-it&quot;&gt;delete the imported NetFSMountURLSync so we can rewrite it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;while-keeping-everything-else-from-netfs-framework&quot;&gt;while keeping everything else from NetFS.framework&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;del NetFSMountURLSync&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;objc.loadBundleFunctions(&lt;strong&gt;bundle&lt;/strong&gt;, globals(), [(&amp;#39;NetFSMountURLSync&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;i@@@@@@o&lt;sup&gt;@&amp;#39;)])&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script&lt;/sup&gt; src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8f09a0b8893c01637b74.js?file=04_snip.py%22%3E&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8f09a0b8893c01637b74.js?file=04_snip.py&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s break down that signature: &lt;code&gt;i@@@@@@o^@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function has 1 return value and 7 input arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html&quot;&gt;Per the documentation&lt;/a&gt;, we start off by defining the return value as &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;int&lt;/strong&gt; type, which is pretty common for functions (usually used for error codes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments follow, starting with 6 &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; which indicates 6 &lt;strong&gt;object&lt;/strong&gt; type arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then magic for the last argument: &lt;code&gt;o^@&lt;/code&gt;: out-only pointer to an &lt;strong&gt;object&lt;/strong&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you provide a signature like this to pyobjc, you still have to pass &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; (null pointer) for the argument, but instead of having to deal with dereferencing pointers it saves you the pain &lt;em&gt;and just moves it to a second return value&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how you use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mountpaths&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;NetFSMountURLSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;share_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mountpaths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;u'/Volumes/sharename'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy cow - IT WORKED AND IT MOUNTED - how freaking cool is that???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like a more polished version of the code in this article, including the ability to mount shares at an arbitrary mount path (the directory has to exist in advance) and the use of some of the open and mount options listed above, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/1362a8908be01e23041d&quot;&gt;you can find it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still lacks %-style encoding (like %20 for a space) for username and password portions of the URL. Exercise is left up to the reader to implement 😄&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customized Python.app Bundles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The python that ships with OS X is not managed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org&quot;&gt;python.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a custom Apple-maintained distribution of python - much in the same way that Apple used to have their own distribution of Java included in OS X (Apple Java is still available, but has been deprecated and doesn&amp;#39;t ship with OS X - &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/rn-osx-10.11/&quot;&gt;10.11 will be the last version to ever have it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, Apple&amp;#39;s python has some customizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/python&lt;/code&gt; is not actually the real &amp;quot;python&amp;quot; binary. It is actually a stub binary that calls the real python interpreter that your OS is configured to use (for more configuration details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afp548.com/2013/04/25/python-versioning-in-os-x/&quot;&gt;my AFP548 article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ships with many third-party modules pre-installed that are not part of the core python distribution, including the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonhosted.org/pyobjc/&quot;&gt;pyobjc&lt;/a&gt;, a personal favorite of mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... and because they want to encourage python &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Objective-C bridging, there is a &amp;quot;Python.app&amp;quot; bundle that&amp;#39;s included, allowing OS X APIs that need application bundle details (Dock icon, display name, etc.) to function. This is where we get the lovely &amp;quot;rocketship&amp;quot;, if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen it before:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-31-customized-python-app-bundles/rocketship.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &amp;quot;Python.app&amp;quot; bundle is located in a subdirectory within /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you &lt;em&gt;really shouldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mess with it or change it - making customization of how python presents itself when it appears in the Dock as a GUI application really annoying. And in 10.11, with the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_11.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016227-DontLinkElementID_19&quot;&gt;System Integrity Protection&lt;/a&gt; it will be &lt;strong&gt;extremely painful&lt;/strong&gt; to make modifications, even if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But SIP isn&amp;#39;t even the biggest issue facing python in 10.11, it&amp;#39;s just made the real culprit worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big baddie coming up is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_11.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016227-DontLinkElementID_18&quot;&gt;App Transport Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is ATS a problem you might ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you write any python code currently on OS X that relies on the NSURL APIs via pyobjc - &lt;em&gt;without performing some major voodoo&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#39;re now going to be restricted to &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; HTTPS connections (and only those that meet the strict/higher encryption requirements of ATS)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that disabling ATS to allow the use of HTTP URLs via NSURL APIs requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/&quot;&gt;special keys in the Info.plist of the application bundle&lt;/a&gt; ... &lt;strong&gt;which are not present in the Apple-provided Python.app&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since you really can&amp;#39;t make changes to the embedded Info.plist (and any changes would go away, potentially, with an OS update), this gets pretty painful pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of us that work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/munki/munki&quot;&gt;munki&lt;/a&gt; learned about this situation when Developer Preview 5 of 10.11 was released (when ATS became enabled), as munki made the switch to using NSURL APIs quite some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of that research, we did figure out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/munki/munki/commit/1dd8329d665d1d724ddc56ea703552effcd42db8&quot;&gt;a crazy fix&lt;/a&gt; that makes munki work again - but some alternative approaches were also discovered, one of which was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bruienne/&quot;&gt;Pepijn Bruienne&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to &amp;quot;stub out&amp;quot; an alternate Python.app bundle which symlinks the /System/Library/Framework/Python.framework resources - &lt;strong&gt;except for&lt;/strong&gt; Info.plist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can provide your own Info.plist and then execute python from within this alternate application bundle and OS X will use your customizations instead! Not only could you override ATS if you wanted to, now you can customize the icon in the Dock, the name in the menubar, the bundle identifier of your python instance - the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to that effect, I wrote a piece of code that quickly stubs out a new Python.app bundle to a location of your choice, complete with icon customization and Info.plist overrides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import sys, os, os.path, tempfile, plistlib, shutil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class TempApp(object):
    def &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;(self, infoPlist_dict, app_path=None, bundle_name=&amp;#39;TempApp&amp;#39;, cleanup=True, app_icon=None):
        # infoPlist_dict: A dict containing key values that should be set/overridden
        #                 vs. the normal Python.app keys.
        #       app_path: The path to where your app should go. Example: &amp;#39;/usr/local/myOrgStuff&amp;#39;
        #                 This directory needs to pre-exist. If app_path is left at None,
        #                 a temporary directory will be created and used and the value of
        #                 cleanup will be forced to True
        #    bundle_name: The name of your .app. This tends to be what shows in the Dock.
        #                 Spaces in the name are ok, but keep it short.
        #        cleanup: If app_path is provided, cleanup set to False will leave the .app
        #                 bundle behind rather than removing it on object destruction.
        #       app_icon: Set to the path of a .icns file if you wish to have a custom app icon
        #
        # Setup our defaults
        super(type(self), self).&lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;()
        self.path           = None
        self.cleanup_parent = False
        self.cleanup        = cleanup
        self.returncode     = 0
        # First we look up which python we&amp;#39;re running with so we know which Python.app to clone
        # ... We&amp;#39;ll just cheat and use the path of &amp;#39;os&amp;#39; which we already imported.
        base_python = os.&lt;strong&gt;file&lt;/strong&gt;.split(os.path.join(&amp;#39;lib&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;python2&amp;#39;),1)[0]
        python_app  = os.path.join(base_python, &amp;#39;Resources&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Python.app&amp;#39;)
        app_name = &amp;#39;%s.app&amp;#39; % (os.path.basename(bundle_name))
        # Now we setup where we want the new Python.app clone to go
        if app_path is None:
            # Dynamically generate a path and force the value of cleanup
            self.cleanup        = True
            # Also need to cleanup the temp directory we made
            self.cleanup_parent = True

        else:

        if app_icon is not None:
            # We create a custom Resources folder and copy the .icns file to the default &amp;#39;PythonInterpreter.icns&amp;#39; inside
            os.makedirs(os.path.join(self.path, &amp;#39;Contents&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Resources&amp;#39;))
            shutil.copyfile(app_icon, os.path.join(self.path, &amp;#39;Contents&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Resources&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;PythonInterpreter.icns&amp;#39;))
        else:

            os.symlink(os.path.join(python_app, &amp;#39;Contents&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Resources&amp;#39;), os.path.join(self.path, &amp;#39;Contents&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Resources&amp;#39;))

        original_infoPlist.update(infoPlist_dict)
        # Write the contents back to the new location
        plistlib.writePlist(original_infoPlist, os.path.join(self.path, &amp;#39;Contents&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Info.plist&amp;#39;))
    def cleanup_app(self):
        # Kill the process if it&amp;#39;s still running
        if self.cleanup:
            # Delete the .app bundle, best effort
            try:
                shutil.rmtree(self.path, True)
            except:
                pass
        if self.cleanup_parent:
            # This was an auto-generated directory, remove it as well
            try:
                shutil.rmtree(os.path.dirname(self.path), True)
            except:
                pass
    def &lt;strong&gt;del&lt;/strong&gt;(self):
        self.cleanup_app()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8e8e09b8c1f5ceb5020b.js?file=01_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it as it&amp;#39;s written here, you&amp;#39;d create a TempApp instance with your customizations and then call it like a normal external executable with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html&quot;&gt;subprocess&lt;/a&gt; and the appropriate arguments (like some code.py file, etc.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;# How to use it, assuming it&amp;#39;s saved to a file named tempapp.py
from tempapp import *
import subprocess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;infoPlist_overrides = {&amp;#39;CFBundleName&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Menu Name&amp;#39;}
myApp  = TempApp(infoPlist_overrides, bundle_name=&amp;#39;Dock Name&amp;#39;, app_icon=&amp;#39;/Users/mike/Desktop/tinker.icns&amp;#39;)
output = subprocess.check_output([myApp.path + &amp;#39;/Contents/MacOS/Python&amp;#39;, path_to_py_file])&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/8e8e09b8c1f5ceb5020b.js?file=02_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... but this is me writing this, so you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python includes another fantastic module called multiprocessing and I especially love the workflow of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#the-process-class&quot;&gt;Process class&lt;/a&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows you to spin up another python interpreter trivially in a new process and easily share data between this child process and the original with things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes&quot;&gt;Queues and Pipes&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you don&amp;#39;t need a chunk of python code in a file - you can just pass a function to the Process class as the &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; argument and it will use that for the core of execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lovely lovely module and I&amp;#39;d recommend using it for any time you&amp;#39;d need to spin up additional python instances ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... except in the specific case of our situation: running a python interpreter from a different path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is: For python 2.6+ for Windows - &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_executable&quot;&gt;they make it trivial to use python at a different path&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For OS X and other Unix platforms, they didn&amp;#39;t add that support &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_executable&quot;&gt;until python 3.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAHHHH!&lt;/strong&gt; So annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... So, I updated my code and added some capability to do that ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, I used the capability of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/marshal.html&quot;&gt;marshal&lt;/a&gt; module to turn python code into a semi-portable (within same python builds on same architecture - not a problem in our situation) data stream that can be passed to another python instance and turned back into functional code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html&quot;&gt;pickle&lt;/a&gt; module to do the same for sending and receiving data between the processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to pass my python code to the child process over stdin (which keeps the code out of the argument list, keeping the output of tools like &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; uncluttered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import sys, os, os.path, tempfile, plistlib, shutil, marshal, subprocess, pickle, textwrap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class TempApp(object):
    &lt;em&gt;skeleton_app = textwrap.dedent(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
                      import sys, marshal, types, pickle
                      main_func_marshal = %s
                      args_pickle       = %s
                      code = marshal.loads(main_func_marshal)
                      main_func = types.FunctionType(code, globals(), &amp;quot;main_func&amp;quot;)
                      args = dict(pickle.loads(args_pickle))
                      returncode, result = main_func(args)
                      print pickle.dumps(result)
                      sys.exit(returncode)
                      &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
    def __init&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(self, infoPlist_dict, app_path=None, bundle_name=&amp;#39;TempApp&amp;#39;, cleanup=True, app_icon=None):
        # infoPlist_dict: A dict containing key values that should be set/overridden

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have full control over the visual representation of python - in the Dock, menubar, and even in application switching and Force Quit dialogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you found this as interesting as I did!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring OS X Preview Signatures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve never used it before, &lt;strong&gt;Preview.app&lt;/strong&gt; has an amazing ability to pull a
signature from the trackpad on your Mac or from the video feed of your FaceTime
camera. The feature is located under the menu &lt;em&gt;Tools -&amp;gt; Annotate -&amp;gt;
Signature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capture experience is pretty magical, second only to (in my opinion) iTunes
using your camera to capture your iTunes gift card codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-26-exploring-os-x-preview-signatures/signature.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it has your signature stored, you can then use the same menu to place your signature into electronic documents like PDFs as transparent image overlays, allowing you to &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-26-exploring-os-x-preview-signatures/award.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;#39;ve stored your signature in your computer, one would hope that Apple spent some time protecting others from accessing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when you create a signature, two primary pieces of data are configured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the user&amp;#39;s login.keychain, an application password keychain item called &amp;quot;Preview Signature Privacy&amp;quot; is created, with the following notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-26-exploring-os-x-preview-signatures/keychain_notes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* &lt;em&gt;(yes, I know this is a 10.10 screenshot - it&amp;#39;s prettier this way)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password contents of this keychain item are a hexadecimal string, representing 16 raw bytes of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second item that&amp;#39;s created is an application preference in the domain com.apple.Preview.signatures for the key &amp;quot;items-1&amp;quot;, which contains an array of data objects. The backend storage for this domain is located in the user&amp;#39;s application containers at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t know me already, I&amp;#39;ll just warn you now that my code here will be in &lt;a href=&quot;http://python.org/&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;. Since we&amp;#39;re going to be working a lot with plists, let&amp;#39;s get a few helper functions defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;def readPlistFromData(data_obj):
    # Reads binary and XML plists from a NSData object / python string / raw bytes
    every_byte = &amp;#39;&amp;#39;.join([x for x in data_obj])
    nsdata_obj = NSData.dataWithBytes_length_(every_byte, len(every_byte))
    data, p_format, error = NSPropertyListSerialization.propertyListFromData_mutabilityOption_format_errorDescription_(nsdata_obj, \
                                                        NSPropertyListMutableContainersAndLeaves, None, None)
    return data
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=01_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has an advantage over the plistlib module included with python in that it can support binary plists as well as just XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#39;s read the com.apple.Preview.signatures preference for the key &amp;quot;item-1&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never. Ever. Read. Preferences. From. Plist. Files. Directly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(... Unless you want to. I mean, I&amp;#39;m not your dad. Go for it if you really want to. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DataManagement/RN-CoreFoundationOlderNotes/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012903-TRANSLATED_CHAPTER_965-SW5&quot;&gt;Apple hates you for it&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However - following my own advice is a little tricky here! The location of the preference is stored on-disk within ~/Library/Containers, indicating this is a sandboxed application preference and isn&amp;#39;t normally meant to be accessed by other apps outside of Preview.app itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But OS X will still let you read the preference, if you provide the full path to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *
import os.path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;signature_array = CFPreferencesCopyValue(&amp;#39;items-1&amp;#39;, \
                     os.path.expanduser(&amp;#39;~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist&amp;#39;), \
                     kCFPreferencesCurrentUser, kCFPreferencesAnyHost)
first_sig = signature_array[0]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=02_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contents of the array is a data object, which if you try to look at it directly, you just see the hex encoding of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you look at the first few characters in it, you might see something recognizable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; str(first_sig)[:50]
'bplist00\xd4\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x1e\x1fX$versionX$objectsY$archiverT$top'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few characters &amp;quot;bplist00&amp;quot; are an indicator that the contents of the array are binary plists themselves. So let&amp;#39;s unpack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sig_plist = readPlistFromData(first_sig)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=03_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sig_plist
{
    &quot;$archiver&quot; = NSKeyedArchiver;
    &quot;$objects&quot; =     (
        &quot;$null&quot;,
                {
[...]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;#39;ve got something new - an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSKeyedArchiver_Class/index.html&quot;&gt;NSKeyedArchiver&lt;/a&gt; object. This is a way for OS X (and iOS) to store data objects in a file-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to decode the object. Let&amp;#39;s try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *
sig_decoded = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData_(first_sig)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=04_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
objc.error: NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException - *** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver decodeObjectForKey:]: cannot decode object of class (PVSignature)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops. Looks like OS X doesn&amp;#39;t know how to natively handle a &amp;quot;PVSignature&amp;quot; file - so where do we learn about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll need to compare two different pieces of information: what&amp;#39;s stored in the NSKeyedArchiver object and what exactly is a PVSignature object?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the PVSignature structure, we&amp;#39;ll need the help of a great tool: &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/&quot;&gt;class-dump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can dump the signature of Objective-C objects defined within applications and frameworks (... hopefully PVSignature is within Preview.app itself!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;class-dump -H /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, our output includes a &amp;quot;PVSignature.h&amp;quot; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s inside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@interface PVSignature : NSObject &amp;lt;NSCoding&amp;gt;
{
    NSData *&lt;em&gt;undecryptedData;
    BOOL _cannotDecrypt;
    PVSignaturePayload *_payload;
    NSImage *_largeThumbnail;
    NSImage *_largeWhiteThumbnail;
    NSImage *_smallThumbnail;
    BOOL _thumbnailsGenerated;
    int _uid;
    BOOL _shouldPersist;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=05&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;snip.m&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s compare that against what&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; stored in the encoded object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When storing a single object, NSKeyedArchiver object stores the object attributes in the 2nd item of the &amp;quot;$objects&amp;quot; key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sig_plist['$objects'][1]
{
    &quot;$class&quot; = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fd3ada65f80 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 4}&quot;;
    data = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fd3ada98480 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 2}&quot;;
    uid = 1000;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like we have a &amp;quot;data&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;uid&amp;quot; values only, unlike everything listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter my next favorite tool: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hopperapp.com&quot;&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;a reverser&amp;#39;s best friend!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Hopper, we&amp;#39;ll read the executable to disassemble located at: /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Preview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once loaded up, we&amp;#39;re going to look under &amp;quot;Labels&amp;quot; for &lt;em&gt;PVSignature initWithCoder&lt;/em&gt; (the method that&amp;#39;s called when unarchiving an instance of a class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we find it, we can use &lt;em&gt;Window -&amp;gt; Show Psuedo Code of Procedure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;[...]
rbx-&amp;gt;_undecryptedData = [[r14 decodeObjectForKey:@&quot;data&quot;] retain];
rbx-&amp;gt;_uid = [r14 decodeInt32ForKey:@&quot;uid&quot;];
rbx-&amp;gt;_cannotDecrypt = 0x0;
rbx-&amp;gt;_shouldPersist = 0x1;
rbx-&amp;gt;_largeThumbnail = 0x0;
rbx-&amp;gt;_smallThumbnail = 0x0;
rbx-&amp;gt;_payload = 0x0;
[...]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty staight forward to immitate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;class PVSignature(NSObject):
    &lt;em&gt;undecryptedData = None
    &lt;em&gt;uid = None
    &lt;em&gt;cannotDecrypt = None
    _shouldPersist = None
    _largeThumbnail = None
    _smallThumbnail = None
    _payload = None
    def init(self):
        self = super(PVSignature, self).init()
        if self == None: return None
        self.&lt;/em&gt;undecryptedData = None
        self.&lt;/em&gt;uid = None
        self.&lt;em&gt;cannotDecrypt = None
        self._shouldPersist = None
        self._largeThumbnail = None
        self.&lt;/em&gt;smallThumbnail = None
        self._payload = None
        return self
    def initWithCoder&lt;/em&gt;(self, coder):
        # use decodeObjectForKey when the key value could be something other than a primitive data type (looks like NSData here...)
        self.&lt;em&gt;undecryptedData = coder.decodeObjectForKey&lt;/em&gt;(u&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;)
        # use decodeIntForKey because it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious from sig_plist[&amp;#39;$objects&amp;#39;][1]
        self.&lt;em&gt;uid = coder.decodeInt32ForKey&lt;/em&gt;(u&amp;quot;uid&amp;quot;)
        self._shouldPersist = 1
        # We won&amp;#39;t set the other values to 0, because in this context that&amp;#39;s actually a null pointer for them
        return self&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;define-our-class-for-itself&quot;&gt;Define our class for itself&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSKeyedUnarchiver.setClass_forClassName_(PVSignature, &amp;quot;PVSignature&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;attempt-to-decode-again&quot;&gt;Attempt to decode again!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sig_decoded = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData_(first_sig)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=06_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay, no errors! Let&amp;#39;s see what our object looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sig_decoded._uid
1000

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sig_decoded._undecryptedData
&amp;lt;458e1def 5434c5ab 94094049 dfd2424d 0ebe7ff6 c79c7b82 463d6d56 ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. Let&amp;#39;s try the trick we did before for checking out if the raw data is anything we recognize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; str(sig_decoded._undecryptedData)[:50]
'E\x8e\x1d\xefT4\xc5\xab\x94\t@I\xdf\xd2BM\x0e\xbe\x7f\xf6\xc7\x9c{\x82F=mV\xac\xee\x1c\xda8\xe357|\xbb\xa9\xf9\xdc\xbd\x16\x1a+6\x16\x90Z\xfc'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Nope. Not ringing any bells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;... It&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s encrypted or something ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, we have that other piece of data - the password value for &amp;quot;Preview Signature Privacy&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Used by Preview to encrypt stored signatures. If modified or deleted, any existing signatures will become unusable.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it&amp;#39;s a decryption key to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to cheat here and just raw copy the value using Keychain Access (just clicking on &amp;quot;Show Password&amp;quot; and copying out the value). &lt;em&gt;(I have code for reading from the keychain, but that&amp;#39;s for another post.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import binascii
hex_key = &amp;#39;E29D5B36A433C4E592B7A3991EF8691C&amp;#39;
binary_key = binascii.unhexlify(hex_key)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=07_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; len(binary_key)
16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 16 byte key. If you know anything about encryption, that&amp;#39;s a pretty common key length for many common &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation&quot;&gt;block cipher (ECB and CBC) algorithms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we need to know exactly what algorithm was used here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Hopper we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching through PVSignature code, this would seem key: &lt;strong&gt;-[PVSignature decrypt]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the pseudocode for it, it generates an instance of a new class &amp;quot;PVSignatureEncryptor&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rax = [PVSignatureEncryptor sharedInstance];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that, we find: &lt;strong&gt;-[PVSignatureEncryptor decryptedData:]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code has exactly what we&amp;#39;re looking for - information about how it decrypts the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;if (CCCrypt(0x1, 0x0, 0x1, r12, 0x10, 0x0, var_68, r14, r15, rax, var_58) == 0x0) {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this instance, we want to look at not just the pseudocode, but also the assembly for a little more clarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;   mov edi, 0x1    ; argument &quot;op&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
   mov esi, 0x0    ; argument &quot;alg&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
   mov edx, 0x1    ; argument &quot;options&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
   mov rcx, r12    ; argument &quot;key&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
   mov r8d, 0x10   ; argument &quot;keyLength&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
   xor r9d, r9d    ; argument &quot;iv&quot; for method imp___stubs__CCCrypt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/CCCrypt.3cc.html&quot;&gt;documentation for CCCrypt&lt;/a&gt;, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;CCCrypt(CCOperation op, CCAlgorithm alg, CCOptions options,
         const void *key, size_t keyLength, const void *iv,
         const void *dataIn, size_t dataInLength, void *dataOut,
         size_t dataOutAvailable, size_t *dataOutMoved);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can figure out the arguments that were passed, with a little help from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto-36064/CommonCrypto/CommonCryptor.h&quot;&gt;CommonCryptor.h header file&lt;/a&gt; and the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;operation/&amp;quot;op&amp;quot;: &lt;strong&gt;0x1&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;kCCDecrypt&lt;/em&gt;, from &amp;lt;CommonCryptor.h&amp;gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;algorithm/&amp;quot;alg&amp;quot;: &lt;strong&gt;0x0&lt;/strong&gt;   (&lt;em&gt;kCCAlgorithmAES128&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;options&amp;quot;: &lt;strong&gt;0x1&lt;/strong&gt;   (&lt;em&gt;kCCOptionPKCS7Padding&lt;/em&gt; in this context)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;key&amp;quot; is probably our &amp;quot;binary_key&amp;quot; from above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;keyLength&amp;quot;: &lt;strong&gt;0x10&lt;/strong&gt; which is hex for 16 - a length that matches the length of our &amp;quot;binary_key&amp;quot; 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;iv&amp;quot;: &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;, aka null pointer / empty value in this context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the arguments we don&amp;#39;t care so much about as they&amp;#39;re for handling getting data into/out of the decryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one last bit from the documentation on CCCrypt, we have everything we need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If CBC mode is selected and no IV is provided, an IV of all zeroes will be used&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now to try decrypting. We&amp;#39;re going to use the python Crypto module for this part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Crypto.Cipher import AES
iv = &amp;#39;\x00&amp;#39;*16  # 16 byte character array of zeroes
cipher = AES.new(binary_key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)
decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(str(sig_decoded.&lt;em&gt;undecryptedData))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=08&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;snip.py&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decrypted_data[:50]
&quot;\xe4\x9c\x0f\xff\xd2\xee`\x0e\xbe8w8\xef\xaaT\xf1\x07\xeas\xe0Z\x96'6\xfc\x95\x9e\xa9\xce\xb5&amp;gt;\xd4bplist00\xd4\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06,-X&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh ho ho!&lt;/em&gt; I see a &lt;strong&gt;bplist00&lt;/strong&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decrypted_data.index('bplist00')
32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like there&amp;#39;s a 32 byte prefix - looking back at the code of &lt;strong&gt;-[PVSignatureEncryptor decryptedData:]&lt;/strong&gt;, we can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;CC_SHA256(rbx, rsi, var_50);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHA-256 is a 32-byte CRC. Likely the decrypted data is prefixed with its CRC hash so that the code can tell easily if it decrypted the signature correctly by validating the hash of the binary plist data matches the hash in the 32 byte prefix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s skip the first 32 bytes and try to parse it directly as a plist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... But before we do that, the &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;kCCOptionPKCS7Padding&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; option that was mentioned earlier means that this data is padded out to a multiple of 16 bytes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; len(decrypted_data)/16.
120.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have to remove the padding per the PKCS7 standard. We can do that with this bit of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class PKCS7Encoder():
    class InvalidBlockSizeError(Exception):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Raised for invalid block sizes&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        pass
    def &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;(self, block_size=16):
        if block_size &amp;lt; 2 or block_size &amp;gt; 255:
            raise PKCS7Encoder.InvalidBlockSizeError(&amp;#39;The block size must be &amp;#39; \
                    &amp;#39;between 2 and 255, inclusive&amp;#39;)
        self.block_size = block_size
    def encode(self, text):
        text_length = len(text)
        amount_to_pad = self.block_size - (text_length % self.block_size)
        if amount_to_pad == 0:
            amount_to_pad = self.block_size
        pad = chr(amount_to_pad)
        return text + pad * amount_to_pad
    def decode(self, text):
        pad = ord(text[-1])
        return text[:-pad]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encoder = PKCS7Encoder()
unpadded_decrypted_data = encoder.decode(decrypted_data)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=09_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can attempt parsing the plist data for bytes 33+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;decrypted_plist = readPlistFromData(unpadded_decrypted_data[32:])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=10_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decrypted_plist
{
    &quot;$archiver&quot; = NSKeyedArchiver;
    &quot;$objects&quot; =     (
        &quot;$null&quot;,
[...]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we have this time? Let&amp;#39;s try to decode it. But since we decrypted with python, our data is a string - need to wrap it into an NSData object first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nsdata_decrypted_plist = NSData.dataWithBytes_length_(unpadded_decrypted_data[32:], len(unpadded_decrypted_data[32:]))
real_sig_decoded = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData_(nsdata_decrypted_plist)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=11_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&quot;, line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;
objc.error: NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException - *** -[NSKeyedUnarchiver decodeObjectForKey:]: cannot decode object of class (PVSignaturePayload)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress - now we&amp;#39;re working with a &amp;quot;PVSignaturePayload&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, let&amp;#39;s look at what data we have, and then compare that against the contents of &amp;quot;PVSignaturePayload.h&amp;quot; from our earlier class-dump run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; decrypted_plist['$objects'][1]
{
    &quot;$class&quot; = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fba02522bd0 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 7}&quot;;
    baselineHeight = &quot;0.1176470592617989&quot;;
    creationDate = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fba025203d0 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 4}&quot;;
    lastUsedDate = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fba025203f0 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 6}&quot;;
    path = &quot;&amp;lt;CFKeyedArchiverUID 0x7fba02520350 [0x7fff7951bed0]&amp;gt;{value = 2}&quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@interface PVSignaturePayload : NSObject &amp;lt;NSCoding&amp;gt;
{
    NSBezierPath *path;
    double baselineHeight;
    NSDate *creationDate;
    NSDate *lastUsedDate;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=12_snip.m&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh goodness - &lt;em&gt;NSBezierPath??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;strong&gt;SOOOO&lt;/strong&gt; close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s vector information, very likely our actual signature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could look back at the code in &lt;strong&gt;Preview.app&lt;/strong&gt; for PVSignaturePayload - but we appear to have a match for a match on everything, &lt;em&gt;let&amp;#39;s just wing it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YAY!&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ve got our vector information!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to verify this is what it is, let&amp;#39;s kick it out to an image file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSBezierPath_Class/index.html&quot;&gt;NSBezierPath&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t have to start at a (0,0) coordinate origin. In fact, the &amp;quot;Bounds&amp;quot; values above indicate it&amp;#39;s offset. So let&amp;#39;s make a transform and shift it back to something more reasonable before we draw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;from Foundation import *
from AppKit import *
import math&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sig_path = real_sig_decoded.path
shift_path = NSAffineTransform.alloc().init()
origin = sig_path.bounds().origin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;we-translate-by-the-opposite-x-and-y-values-with-0-1-to-nudge-it-into-the-positive&quot;&gt;We translate by the opposite X and Y values - with +0.1 to nudge it into the positive&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shift_path.translateXBy_yBy_(origin.x * -1. + 0.1, origin.y * -1. + 0.1)
sig_path_shifted = sig_path.copy()
sig_path_shifted.transformUsingAffineTransform_(shift_path)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=14_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-&quot; data-lang=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sig_path_shifted
Path &amp;lt;0x7fba04ef0000&amp;gt;
  Bounds: {{0.10000000000000142, 0.10000000000000001}, {271.91783064182891, 67}}
  Control point bounds: {{-0.64194097622566915, -1.8758532047271763}, {274.53815460205078, 68.975853204727173}}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better. Now we&amp;#39;re just inside (0,0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to build an image and draw the path onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I&amp;#39;m gonna race through this a bit here because we&amp;#39;re so close to the end!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import os.path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bounds = sig_path_shifted.bounds()
width = int(math.ceil(bounds.origin.x + bounds.size.width))
height = int(math.ceil(bounds.origin.y + bounds.size.height))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-a-pixels-bitmap-to-draw-onto&quot;&gt;Build a pixels bitmap to draw onto&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;signature_bitmap = NSBitmapImageRep.alloc().initWithBitmapDataPlanes_pixelsWide_pixelsHigh_bitsPerSample_samplesPerPixel_hasAlpha_isPlanar_colorSpaceName_bytesPerRow_bitsPerPixel_(None, width, height, 8, 4, True, False, NSDeviceRGBColorSpace, 0, 0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;save-our-current-graphic-information-we-really-don-39-t-care-but-it-39-s-polite&quot;&gt;Save our current graphic information (we really don&amp;#39;t care, but it&amp;#39;s polite)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSGraphicsContext.saveGraphicsState()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;set-the-focus-to-our-bitmap&quot;&gt;Set the focus to our bitmap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSGraphicsContext.setCurrentContext_(NSGraphicsContext.graphicsContextWithBitmapImageRep_(signature_bitmap))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;set-the-color-to-black&quot;&gt;Set the color to black&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSColor.blackColor().setFill()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;fill-our-signature-on-the-bitmap-with-black&quot;&gt;Fill our signature on the bitmap with black&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sig_path_shifted.fill()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;restore-our-previous-graphics-state&quot;&gt;Restore our previous graphics state&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSGraphicsContext.restoreGraphicsState()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-a-data-stream-of-a-png-from-our-bitmap&quot;&gt;Build a data stream of a PNG from our bitmap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data = signature_bitmap.representationUsingType_properties_(NSPNGFileType, None)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;save-it-to-a-file&quot;&gt;Save it to a file&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;result = data.writeToFile_atomically_(os.path.expanduser(&amp;quot;~/Desktop/my_signature.png&amp;quot;), True)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick/785a464ab1b0fffe5fa7.js?file=15_snip.py&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;veni-vidi-vici&quot;&gt;veni, vidi, vici!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-26-exploring-os-x-preview-signatures/winnar_is_you.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-notes&quot;&gt;final notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire post was about signatures in 10.9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signatures in 10.10+ have taken a new turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the com.apple.Preview.signatures preference domain appears to be legacy: when you upgrade 10.9 to 10.10, OS X appears to perform a one-time conversion of your signatures into the new format. &lt;em&gt;(Speculation on my part - calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rtrouton/&quot;&gt;Rich&lt;/a&gt;, master of OS X VMs, to verify ...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 10.10+, signatures appear to be stored entirely in the keychain - but not your login.keychain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now every signature gets a &amp;quot;Signature Annotation Privacy&amp;quot; item in your &amp;quot;Local Items&amp;quot; keychain (which may be named &amp;quot;iCloud Keychain&amp;quot;, if you&amp;#39;ve enabled that function with your iCloud account).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of an encryption key stored in the password value, &lt;em&gt;an entire binary plist appears to be there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the note has changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Signatures for AnnotationKit (shared by e.g. Sketch &amp;amp; Preview). Deletion will remove all signatures from the list.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done some initial investigations into this binary plist value and as expected, the contents are not like they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue looking into it (and maybe write about what I find at some point ...)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Home for my Long-form Rambling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For quite some time, my friends have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tvsutton/status/565118553809235968&quot;&gt;nagging
me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Vaughn_E_Miller/status/603232042772516866&quot;&gt;to put
together&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/foigus/status/608800195707564032&quot;&gt;a
blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blame this site on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been sharing code and tips in random &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/pudquick&quot;&gt;Github
gists&lt;/a&gt; for several years via
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikeymikey&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; and online chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably keep doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now if it’s interesting enough to write about but I can’t fit it into 140
characters, it’ll probably end up here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it doesn’t - now I have no excuse to avoid blogging about it when you nag
me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy now?&lt;/p&gt;
